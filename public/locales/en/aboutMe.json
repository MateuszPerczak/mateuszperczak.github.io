  "aboutMeDescription": "Hi, my name is Mathew and I like programming. In 2015 I learned python and I wrote some basic apps. Unfortunately, I wasn't happy with the speed at which python run my code. Ofc I tried to optimize my apps as best as I could but I didn't change much. I've decided to switch to the compiled language, mainly for some speed bust at running code. I'm not sure if C# was the best choice.  I quickly realized that I was forced to use objects for everything. So here I am now writing web apps using popular frameworks.",
